The concept of “IQ.” The inventors of the IQ test claimed it measured “innate intelligence.” But of course what the test really measures is test-taking ability. The problems with all the work purporting to link “race” and “intelligence” have been well-known for decades. The average IQ of immigrants in the United States is substantially lower than that 
of the white native population, and the difference is likely to persist over several generations.  
The consequences are a lack of socioeconomic assimilation among low-IQ immigrant groups, 
more underclass behavior, less social trust, and an increase in the proportion of unskilled 
workers in the American labor market.  Selecting high-IQ immigrants would ameliorate these 
problems in the U.S., while at the same time benefiting smart potential immigrants who lack 
educational access in their home countries. His idea that Latinos won't assimilate because they're doomed to low IQs for generations is offensive. The most obvious problem with Heritage's study is its economic analysis, not social analysis. The idea that Latinos won't assimilate because they're doomed to low IQs for generations is offensive.
